title: Kerberos and HDFS
short: |
  Do you know what _"RULE:\[2:$1@$0](dn@EXAMPLE.COM)s/.*/hdfs/"_ means? This is not mojibake. This is part of HDFS configuration, and it looks intimidating (at least it did to me). This blog post explains what it really means and how kerberos configuration works with HDFS in detail.

## The Question
This blog post explains basics of kerberos configuration for HDFS. But let me ask you a question here first, and I will be explaining the answer step by step and you be a bit more knowledgable of the security configuration at the end.

_Can you explain under what setting a user foo on host1.com can access to files on HDFS below_

```
[pivotal@ip-10-32-37-53 ~]$ hadoop fs -ls /user 
drwxr-x--- - jennifer smith 0 2016-02-13 00:29 /user/jennifer 
```

_with a kerberos principal john/doe@EXMAPLE.COM just because a linux user called jane on host2.com belongs to a group called smith?_

Is it pretty twisting?

Let me draw a diagram.

From next section, we are going to find out the answer step by step.


## foo and John Doe, how can they be associated?

{{< responsive-figure src="/images/kerberos-and-hdfs-foo-and-john-doe.png" class="left" >}}

We go step by step. First, let's see how foo can be john/doe

Here, we are going to use keytab. _xst_ or _ktadd_ are the command to create keytab.

~~~bash
xst -norandkey -k /etc/security/keytabs/john.doe.keytab john/doe@PIVOTAL.IO
~~~

_kinit_ is the command to consume keytab

~~~bash
su - foo # You are foo
kinit -kt /etc/security/keytabs/john.doe.keytab john/doe@PIVOTAL.IO # Now you are john/doe 
~~~

Done.

We keep finding how each association is established this way. Next...

## John to Jane


_copied from [the README](https://github.com/pivotal/blog#writing-a-good-post)..._

### Keep it technical.

People want to to be educated and enlightened.  Our audience are engineers, so the way to reach them is through code.  The more code samples, the better.

### Nobody likes a wall of text.


Use headers to break up your text.  Each image you add to your post increases its XP by 100.  Diagrams, screen shots, or humorous "meme" (_|memƒÅ|_) gifs...  They all add color.  If you don't have [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle), then submit an ask ticket.  There's no excuse for monotony.

### Your 10th grade teacher was right.

Make use of the hamburger technique.  Your audience doesn't have a lot of time.  Tell them what you're going to write, write it, and then tell them what you've written.  Spend time on your opening.  Make it click.

### Pair all the time.

We do everything as a team, and this is no different.  Get feedback from your friends and coworkers.  Show them the post on the staging site, and ask them to tear it apart.

### Make it pretty.

Pivotal-ui comes with a bunch of nice helpers.  Make use of them.  Check out the example styles below:

# Header 1 

Don't use this, since it looks like a main title.

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6
